Built an engaging "Simon Says" game that challenges players to recall and repeat button sequences with increasing difficulty. The game includes dynamically styled buttons that flash in sequences, with each level adding to the complexity. Each button is color-coded to evoke moods—joyful yellows and oranges, wise blues, and sweet pinks—enhancing the user experience. A clear game-over message is displayed when a player misses a sequence, with an option to restart. This project showcases front-end development skills, user interface animation, and JavaScript logic in creating an intuitive and fun user experience.
